Python Mini-Projects Collection
A repository of simple, practical, logic-based Python scripts demonstrating core programming concepts, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and user-interface simulation in the CLI.


 
Games & Fun
* **Rock, Paper, Scissors**: A classic game against the system with score tracking.
* **Slot Machine**: A casino-style simulator featuring wagering, balance management, and randomized rolling animations using time delays.
* **Number Guessing**: A "higher or lower" logic game where the user finds a hidden number within a dynamic loop.
* **Dice Roll**: A simple utility to simulate a 6-sided die.

Utilities
* **Calculator**: A CLI calculator that handles mathematical expressions and includes error handling for division by zero.
* **Temperature Converter**: A conversion tool supporting Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit scales.

Management Systems (OOP)
* **Library Management**: Uses dictionaries and classes to track books, authors, and member rentals.
* **Bank Account System**: Simulates banking operations including user registration, deposits, and withdrawals.
* **Course Registration**: A university simulation managing student enrollment, credit limits, and different course types like Online and Offline.
* **Cricket Player Tracker**: Demonstrates advanced OOP concepts like inheritance and multiple inheritance to calculate player statistics.

File Management
* **File Organizer**: Automated script to sort files into folders based on extensions.
* **Batch Renamer**: A tool to rename multiple files following a specific pattern.




General Features
* **Exit Logic:** Most programs include a check for the keyword `'exit'`, allowing the user to quit at any prompt.
* **Input Validation:** Programs are designed to handle improper data types (like entering text when a number is expected) without crashing.
